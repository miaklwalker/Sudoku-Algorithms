groups will hold a list of id's 

cells will hold a value 

The Finders will all directly work with puzzle and master list

puzzle for each group
    neededValues = []
    candidates = {
        1 : [member]

    neededValues for each value
        group for each member 
            if(member potential has neededValue)
